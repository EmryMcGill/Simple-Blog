    The Goal: to climb Mt. Liverpool in Aspiring National Park.
    <br>
    <br>
    Friday morning we got off to an early start leaving Dunedin around 6.
    Around 4 hours later we could start to see the glaciated mountains.

    We met with the whole group (11 of us) at the car park around 12 and were soon on
    our way. The track first followed a river on the Matukituki Valley floor were we where 
    greeted by beutiful views of the mountains and plenty of sheep.

    After a 9km stroll through the valley it was time to put our leg muscles to use
    and start asending to the ridge line. The track got steeper the further, but it
    was nice to be out of the sun.

    Eventually we broke out of the bushline and got some stunning views of the valley
    below.

    The track got a lot steeper after this point, and a bit of a sramble in sections.

    After a tiring 6km push we made it to the ridge! From here was only a short 45min
    walk desending the other side of the ridge to our camp.
